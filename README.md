Retail Investor Education App
App Synopsis – Retail Investor Education Platform
Our app is a Retail Investor Education & Protection Platform designed to empower everyday investors with transparency, awareness, and practical learning tools.  
Retail investors often fall victim to misleading brokers, hidden charges, and fraudulent schemes, while lacking the means to test strategies safely. This app addresses those pain points through four core features:  
1. Broker Transparency Hub – A verified registry of genuine brokers with licensing details, fee/commission structures, and direct safe links to their official platforms. 
2. Fraud & Risk Alert System – An AI-enabled red-flag engine that warns users about suspicious brokers or schemes and provides a due diligence checklist.  
3. Learning Through Case Studies – Bite-sized, real-world examples of bankruptcies and financial fraud cases with key lessons to help users recognize warning signs.  
4. Investment Backtesting Tool – A simulation engine where users can test “what-if” scenarios on historical data to understand investment outcomes before committing real money.
